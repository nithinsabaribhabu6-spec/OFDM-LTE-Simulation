## How to Run

### MATLAB Simulation
1. Open `ofdm_simulation.m` in MATLAB.
2. Run the script.
3. Observe **BER vs SNR plots** comparing AWGN and Rayleigh channels.

### Python MAC Scheduling (Optional)
1. Open `mac_scheduler.py` in Python.
2. Run the script to see **throughput vs fairness analysis** for multiple users.

## Outcome
- Demonstrates **robustness of OFDM** against multipath interference.
- Provides insights into **efficient traffic scheduling** in LTE networks.
- Ready-to-use framework for wireless communication and networking experiments.
