# OFDM-LTE-Simulation
OFDM-Based LTE System Simulation: Simulated an OFDM transmitterâ€“receiver system in MATLAB with QPSK modulation over AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels. Evaluated BER vs. SNR and implemented optional MAC-layer scheduling in Python to analyze throughput vs. fairness, demonstrating robustness and network optimization insights.
